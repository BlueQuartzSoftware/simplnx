# ITK Dilate Object Morphology Image Filter

dilation of an object in an image

## Group (Subgroup)

ITKBinaryMathematicalMorphology (BinaryMathematicalMorphology)

## Description

Dilate an image using binary morphology. Pixel values matching the object value are considered the "foreground" and all other pixels are "background". This is useful in processing mask images containing only one object.

If a pixel's value is equal to the object value and the pixel is adjacent to a non-object valued pixel, then the kernel is centered on the object-value pixel and neighboring pixels covered by the kernel are assigned the object value. The structuring element is assumed to be composed of binary values (zero or one).* ObjectMorphologyImageFilter , ErodeObjectMorphologyImageFilter
