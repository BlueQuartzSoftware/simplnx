# ITK Binary Thinning Image Filter (ITKBinaryThinningImage)

This filter computes one-pixel-wide edges of the input image.

## Group (Subgroup)

ITKBinaryMathematicalMorphology (BinaryMathematicalMorphology)

## Description

This class is parameterized over the type of the input image and the type of the output image.

The input is assumed to be a binary image. If the foreground pixels of the input image do not have a value of 1, they are rescaled to 1 internally to simplify the computation.

The filter will produce a skeleton of the object. The output background values are 0, and the foreground values are 1.

This filter is a sequential thinning algorithm and known to be computational time dependable on the image size. The algorithm corresponds with the 2D implementation described in:

Rafael C. Gonzales and Richard E. Woods. Digital Image Processing. Addison Wesley, 491-494, (1993).
