# ITK Morphological Watershed Image Filter (ITKMorphologicalWatershedImage)

Watershed segmentation implementation with morphological operators.

## Group (Subgroup)

ITKWatersheds (Watersheds)

## Description

Watershed pixel are labeled 0. TOutputImage should be an integer type. Labels of output image are in no particular order. You can reorder the labels such that object labels are consecutive and sorted based on object size by passing the output of this filter to a RelabelComponentImageFilter .

The morphological watershed transform algorithm is described in Chapter 9.2 of Pierre Soille's book "Morphological Image Analysis:
Principles and Applications", Second Edition, Springer, 2003.

This code was contributed in the Insight Journal paper: "The watershed transform in ITK - discussion and new developments" by Beare R., Lehmann G. https://www.insight-journal.org/browse/publication/92

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Level | float64 |  |
| MarkWatershedLine | bool | Set/Get whether the watershed pixel must be marked or not. Default is true. Set it to false do not only avoid writing watershed pixels, it also decrease algorithm complexity. |
| FullyConnected | bool | Set/Get whether the connected components are defined strictly by face connectivity or by face+edge+vertex connectivity. Default is FullyConnectedOff. For objects that are 1 pixel wide, use FullyConnectedOn. |

## Required Geometry

Image Geometry

## Required Objects

| Name |Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| Input Image Geometry | DataPath | DataPath to the Input Image Geometry |
| Input Image Data Array | DataPath | Path to input image with pixel type matching ScalarPixelIDTypeList |

## Created Objects

| Name |Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| Output Image Data Array | DataPath | Path to output image with pixel type matching ScalarPixelIDTypeList |
