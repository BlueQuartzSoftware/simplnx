# Map Point Cloud to Regular Grid

## Group (Subgroup)

Sampling (Mapping)

## Description

This **Filter** determines, for a user-defined grid, in which voxel each point in a **Vertex Geometry** lies.  The user can either construct a sampling grid by specifying the dimensions, or select a pre-existing **Image Geometry** to use as the sampling grid.  The voxel indices that each point lies in are stored on the vertices.  

Additionally, the user may opt to use a mask; points for which the mask are false are ignored when computing voxel indices (instead, they are initialized to voxel 0).
