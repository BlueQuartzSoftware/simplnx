# Extract Vertex Geometry

## Group (Subgroup)

Core Filters (Geometry)

## Description

This filter will extract all the voxel centers of an Image Geometry or a RectilinearGrid geometry
into a new Vertex Geometry. The user is given the option to copy or move cell arrays over to the
newly created VertexGeometry. The user can also supply a mask array which has the effect of only
creating a vertex if the mask value = TRUE.

% Auto generated parameter table will be inserted here
