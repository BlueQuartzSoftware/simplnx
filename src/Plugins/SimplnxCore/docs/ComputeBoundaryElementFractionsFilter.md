# Compute Feature Boundary Element Fractions

## Group (Subgroup)

Statistics (Morphological)

## Description

This **Filter** calculates the fraction of **Elements** of each **Feature** that are on the "surface" of that **Feature**.  The **Filter** simply iterates through all **Elements** asking for the **Feature** that owns them and if the **Element** is a "surface" **Element**.  Each **Feature** counts the total number of **Elements** it owns and the number of those **Elements** that are "surface" **Elements**.  The fraction is then stored for each **Feature**.
