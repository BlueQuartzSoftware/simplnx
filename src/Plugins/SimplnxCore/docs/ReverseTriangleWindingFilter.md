# Reverse Triangle Winding

## Group (Subgroup)

Surface Meshing (Connectivity/Arrangement)

## Description

This **Filter** reverses the *winding* for each **Triangle** in a **Triangle Geometry**. This will *reverse* the direction of calculated **Triangle** normals. Some analysis routines require the normals to be pointing "away" from the center of a **Feature**. This **Filter** allows for manipulation of this construct.
