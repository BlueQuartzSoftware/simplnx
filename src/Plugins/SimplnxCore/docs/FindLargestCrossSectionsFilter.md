# Find Feature Largest Cross-Section Areas

## Group (Subgroup)

Statistics (Morphological)

## Description

This **Filter** calculates the largest cross-sectional area on a user-defined plane for all **Features**.  The **Filter** simply iterates through all **Cells** (on each section) asking for **Feature** that owns them.  On each section, the count of **Cells** for each **Feature** is then converted to an area and stored as the *LargestCrossSection* if the area for the current section is larger than the existing *LargestCrossSection* for that **Feature**.
