# Remove/Extract Flagged Features

## Group (Subgroup)

Processing (Cleanup)

## Description

This **Filter** will remove **Features** that have been flagged by another **Filter** from the structure.  The **Filter** requires that the user point to a boolean array at the **Feature** level that tells the **Filter** whether the **Feature** should remain in the structure.  If the boolean array is *false* for a **Feature**, then all **Cells** that belong to that **Feature** are temporarily *unassigned*. Optionally, after all *undesired* **Features** are removed, the remaining **Features** are isotropically coarsened to fill in the gaps left by the removed **Features**.

## Caveats

This filter will **ONLY** run on an Image Geometry.
