## Description

This **Filter** determines the **Ensemble** of each **Feature** by querying the **Ensemble** of the **Elements** that belong to the **Feature**. Note that it is assumed that all **Elements** belonging to a **Feature** are of the same **Feature**, and thus any **Element** can be used to determine the **Ensemble** of the **Feature** that owns that **Element**.
