## Description

This **Filter** assigns an **Ensemble** Id number to binary data. The *true* **Cells** will be **Ensemble** 1, and *false* **Cells** will be **Ensemble** 0. This **Filter** is generally useful when the **Cell Ensembles** were not known ahead of time. For example, if an image is segmented into precipitates and non-precipitates, this **Filter** will assign the precipitates to **Ensemble** 1, and the non-precipitates to **Ensemble** 0.
