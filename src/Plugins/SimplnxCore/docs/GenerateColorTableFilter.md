# Generate Color Table

## Description

This **Filter** generates a color table array for a given 1-component input array.  Each element of the input array
is normalized and converted to a color based on where the value falls in the spectrum of the selected color preset.

The user can apply an optional data mask and then set the RGB values (0-255) that will be used if the data mask has a FALSE
value.
