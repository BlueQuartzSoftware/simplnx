# Align Sections (List)


## Group (Subgroup) ##

Reconstruction (Alignment)

## Description ##

This **Filter** will apply the cell shifts from a user specified txt file to each section of an Image Geometry. It accepts an alignment .txt file that has full **Cells** shifts that have already been calculated in it.  

If the alignment file was generated by another DREAM.3D alignment filter then the DREAM.3D Alignment File format option should be turned on and the format of the first 6 columns of each row in the file should be as follows:
    slice_m slice_m+1 newxshift newyshift xshifts yshifts
    slice_n slice_n+1 newxshift newyshift xshifts yshifts
    etc...


Otherwise, the format of the file is as follows:

    slice_number xshift yshift
    slice_number xshift yshift
    slice_number xshift yshift
    etc...

The slices must be ordered from the bottom of the sample to the top of the sample (i.e., the first line of shifts should be the second slice relative to the first, then the next line is the third slice relative to the second, and so on). Also, the file must be either space or tab delimited.

## Parameters ##

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------| ----------- |
| Input File | File Path | The input .txt file path containing the shifts to apply to the sections |
| DREAM.3D Alignment File | Bool | Turn this ON if the alignment file was generated by another DREAM.3D Alignment filter |
