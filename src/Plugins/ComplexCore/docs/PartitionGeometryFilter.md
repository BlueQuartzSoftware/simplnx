# Partition Geometry

## Group (Subgroup) ##

Reconstruction (Reconstruction)

## Description ##

This **Filter** generates a partition grid and assigns partition IDs for every voxel/node of a given geometry.

If the **Filter** determines that any voxel/node of the original geometry is out-of-bounds compared to the generated partition grid, the **Out-Of-Bounds Cell ID** will be used as the partition ID in the output partition IDs array.

## Partitioning Modes ##
There are four available partitioning modes to choose from: **1. Basic**, **2. Advanced**, **3. Bounding Box**, and **4. Existing Partition Grid**

### Basic ###

This partitioning mode is commonly used to create a partition grid that is exactly the same size as the input geometry and divided up into a specific number of cells in the X, Y, & Z dimensions.  This mode requires the **Starting Feature ID**, **Number of Cells Per Axis**, and (optionally) the **Use Vertex Mask** input parameters.

In **Figure 1** above, the PartitionGeometry filter is using the SmallIN100 image geometry as an input geometry to generate a 5x5x5 partition grid with 125 features and the following outputs:

1. An image geometry called **Partition Grid Geometry** with a data array containing all the partition grid ids called **Feature Ids**.
2. An attribute matrix called **Cell Data** that contains all the cell data arrays for the newly created partition grid.
3. A cell data array called **Feature Ids** that contains the newly created partition grid's ids.
4. An attribute matrix called **Feature Data**, used to store any future feature data for the given SmallIN100 input geometry.
5. A cell data array called **Partition Ids** that contains the assigned partition ids for all voxels in the SmallIN100 input geometry.

In **Figure 1A** above, feature ID 111 is shown highlighted in the newly created partition grid.  In **Figure 1B** above, the same 111 feature ID is shown as the assigned partition ID for the currently highlighted voxel.

### **Advanced** ###

This partitioning mode is commonly used to create a custom sized partition grid that the input geometry may or may not fit within.  This mode requires the **Starting Feature ID**, **Out-of-Bounds Feature ID**, **Number of Cells Per Axis**, **Partition Grid Origin**, **Cell Length**, and (optionally) the **Use Vertex Mask** input parameters.

_Note_: If the given input geometry does not fit within the partition grid, any out of bounds voxels/nodes will be assigned the **Out-of-Bounds Feature ID** as their **Partition ID**.

In **Figure 2** above, the PartitionGeometry filter is using the SmallIN100 image geometry as an input geometry to generate a 12x4x6 partition grid with 288 features, cell length 5x19x7, and the following outputs:

1. An image geometry called **Partition Grid Geometry** with a data array containing all the partition grid ids called **Feature Ids**.
2. An attribute matrix called **Cell Data** that contains all the cell data arrays for the newly created partition grid.
3. A cell data array called **Feature Ids** that contains the newly created partition grid's ids.
4. An attribute matrix called **Feature Data**, used to store any future feature data for the given SmallIN100 input geometry.
5. A cell data array called **Partition Ids** that contains the assigned partition ids for all voxels in the SmallIN100 input geometry.

In **Figure 2A** above, the newly created partition grid is shown.  It is a 12x4x6 grid with an origin of (-50, -15, -40), and cell length 5x19x7.

In **Figure 2B** above, the partition grid is sliced open to show the SmallIN100 dataset that is contained inside of it.  The SmallIN100 dataset has partition IDs that correspond to the feature IDs in the partition grid.

| ![](Images/PartitionGeometry/Advanced_Mode_2.png) |

In **Figure 3** above, the PartitionGeometry filter is using the SmallIN100 image geometry as an input geometry to generate a 5x4x6 partition grid with 120 features, cell lengths 4x19x7.

In **Figure 3A** above, the newly created partition grid is shown intersecting the SmallIN100 dataset.  Any part of the SmallIN100 dataset that is outside the partition grid is marked with the **Out-of-Bounds Feature ID**, which in this case is 0.

In **Figure 3B** above, the SmallIN100 dataset is sliced open to show the partition IDs that have been set with the corresponding feature IDs from the partition grid.

### **Bounding Box** ###

This partitioning mode is commonly used to create a custom sized partition grid using a minimum and maximum grid coordinate.  The input geometry may or may not fit within this partition grid.  This mode is very similar to the **Advanced** partitioning mode; it requires the **Starting Feature ID**, **Out-of-Bounds Feature ID**, **Number of Cells Per Axis**, **Minimum Grid Coordinate**, **Maximum Grid Coordinate**, and (optionally) the **Use Vertex Mask** input parameters.  Basically, instead of specifying a partition grid origin and cell length to determine the location and physical size of the partition grid, the minimum and maximum grid coordinates are used.

In **Figure 4** above, the PartitionGeometry filter is using the SmallIN100 image geometry as an input geometry to generate a 5x5x5 partition grid with 125 features, a minimum coordinate of (-42, 5, -24), and a maximum coordinate of (-4.75, 45.25, -4.75).

In **Figure 4A** above, the SmallIN100 dataset is shown.  In **Figure 4B** above, the dataset is sliced to show the newly created partition grid contained within.  The partition grid is about 5 units smaller on all sides compared to the SmallIN100 input geometry.

### **Existing Partition Grid** ###

This partitioning mode is chosen when the user already has a partition grid from a previous run of the Partition Geometry filter.  Just select an existing **Partition Grid Geometry** and pick the **Out-of-Bounds Feature ID**, and then partition IDs will be assigned to the input dataset when the filter is executed.

## Using A Vertex Mask ##

On all partitioning modes, a vertex mask can be used with a vertex-based input geometry to determine which vertices should be assigned a valid partition ID.  Any vertices with a mask value of 0 or False will have its Partition ID set to the Out-of-Bounds Feature ID.
