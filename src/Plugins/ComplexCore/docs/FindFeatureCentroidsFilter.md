# Find Feature Centroids

## Group (Subgroup)

Generic (Misc)

## Description

This **Filter** calculates the *centroid* of each **Feature** by determining the average X, Y, and Z position of all the **Cells** belonging to the **Feature**. Note that **Features** that intersect the outer surfaces of the sample will still have *centroids* calculated, but they will be *centroids* of the truncated part of the **Feature** that lies inside the sample.
