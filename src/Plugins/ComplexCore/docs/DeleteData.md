# Delete Data

## Group (Subgroup)

Core (Memory/Management)

## Description

This **Filter** allows the user to remove specified objects from the existing structure. This can be helpful if the user has operations that need as much memory as possible and there are extra objects that are not needed residing in memory. Alternatively, this **Filter** allows the user to remove objects that may share a name with another object further in the **Pipeline** that another **Filter** tries to create, since DREAM.3D generally does not allows objects at the same hierarchy to share the same name.
