## Group (Subgroup)

Core (Generation)

## Description

This **Filter** creates an **Image Geometry** specifically for the representation of a 3D rectilinear grid of voxels (3D) or pixels
(2D). Each axis can have its starting point (origin), resolution, and length defined for the **Geometry**. The **Data Container** in which to place the **Image Geometry** must be specified.

### Example Usage

If you are reading in raw binary data that represents data on a rectilinear grid, the user will need to run this
filter first to create a description of the **Geometry**.
