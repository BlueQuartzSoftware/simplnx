DREAM3D Review (Statistics)

## Description ##

This **Filter** computes a variety of statistics for a given scalar array.  The currently available statistics are array length, minimum, maximum, (arithmetic) mean, median, standard deviation, and summation; any combination of these statistics may be computed by this **Filter**.  Any scalar array, of any primitive type, may be used as input.  The type of the output arrays depends on the kind of statistic computed:

| Statistic | Primitive Type |
|----------|-----------|
| Histogram | float (of user set component size) |
| Length | signed 64-bit integer |
| Minimum | same type as input |
| Maximum | same type as input |
| Mean | double |
| Median | double |
| Standard Deviation | double |
| Summation | double |
| Standardized | double |

The user may optionally use a mask to specify points to be ignored when computing the statistics; only points where the supplied mask is _true_ will be considered when computing statistics.  Additionally, the user may select to have the statistics computed per **Feature** or **Ensemble** by supplying an Ids array.  For example, if the user opts to compute statistics per **Feature** and selects an array that has 10 unique **Feature** Ids, then this **Filter** will compute 10 sets of statistics (e.g., find the mean of the supplied array for each **Feature**, find the total number of points in each **Feature** (the length), etc.).  

The input array may also be _standardized_, meaning that the array values will be adjusted such that they have a mean of 0 and unit variance.  This _Standardize Data_ option requires the selection of both the _Find Mean_ and _Find Standard Deviation_ options.  The standardized data will be saved as a new array object stored in the same **Attribute Matrix** as the input array.  Note that if the _Standardize Data_ option is selected, the mean and standard deviation values created by this **Filter** reflect the mean and standard deviation of the _original_ array; the new standardized array has a mean of 0 and unit variance.  The standardized array will be computed in double precision.  If the statistics are being computed per **Feature** or **Ensemble**, then the array values are standardized according to the mean and standard deviation _for each **Feature/Ensemble**_.  For example, if 5 unique **Features** were being analyzed and _Standardize Data_ was selected, then the array values for **Feature** 1 would be standardized according to the mean and standard deviation for **Feature** 1, then the array values for **Feature** 2 would be standardized according to the mean and standard deviation for **Feature** 2, and so on for the remaining **Features**.  

The user must select a destination **Attribute Matrix** in which the computed statistics will be stored.  If electing to _Compute Statistics Per Feature/Ensemble_, then a reasonable selection for this array is the **Feature/Ensemble** **Attribute Matrix** associated with the supplied **Feature/Ensemble** Ids.  However, the only requirement is that the number of columns in the selected destination **Attribute Matrix** match the number of **Features/Ensembles** specified by the supplied Id array.  This requirement is enforced at run time.  If computing statistics for the entire input array, then only one value is computed per statistic; therefore, the arrays produced only contain one value.  In this case, the destination **Attribute Matrix** should only contain 1 tuple.  If such a **Generic Attribute Matrix** does not exist, it [can be created](@ref createattributematrix).

Special operations occur for certain statistics if the supplied array is of type _bool_ (for example, a mask array produced [when thresholding](@ref multithresholdobjects)).  The length, minimum, maximum, median, and summation are computed as normal (although the resulting values may be platform dependent).  The mean and standard deviation for a boolean array will be true if there are more instances of true in the array than false.  If _Standardize Data_ is chosen for a boolean array, no actual modifications will be made to the input.  These operations for boolean inputs are chosen as a basic convention, and are not intended be representative of true boolean logic.
