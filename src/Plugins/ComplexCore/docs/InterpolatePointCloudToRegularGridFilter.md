Interpolate Point Cloud to Regular Grid
=============

## Group (Subgroup) ##

Sampling (Interpolation)

## Description ##

This **Filter** interpolates the values of arrays stored in a **Vertex Geometry** onto a user-selected **Image Geometry**.  The use defines the (x,y,z) radii of a kernel is *real space units*.  This kernel can be intialized to either *uniform* or *Gaussian*.  The interpolation algorithm proceeds as follows:

1. The kernel radii defined by the user in real space units are converted into voxel units, based on the spacing of the supplied **Image Geometry**.
2. The kernel is centered on each vertex in the **Vertex Geometry**.
3. The values of each **Attribute Array** on the centered vertex are associated to each voxel intersected by the kernel.  This stored value is multiplied by the value of the kernel.

The result of the above approach is a list of data at each voxel in the **Image Geometry** for each interpolated **Attribute Array**.  These lists may be of different lengths within each voxel, since the kernels from each point may overlap. This duplication may result in significant memory usage if the number of points is large; the user may select a subset of arrays to interpolate to alleviate this issue.  Note that all arrays selected for interpolation must be scalar.

A mask may be supplied to the filter.  Points that are not within the mask are ignored during interpolation.  Additionally, the distances between each voxel and the source point for the intersecting kernel may be stored; this significantly increases the required memory.  Arrays may be passed through to the image geometry without applying any interpolation.  This operation is equivalent to used a uniform kernel.
