# Generate Feature Face Misorientations

## Group (Subgroup)

Processing (Crystallography)

## Description

This **Filter** generates a 3 component vector for each **Triangle** in a **Triangle Geometry** that is the axis-angle of the misorientation associated with the **Features** that lie on either side of the **Triangle**.  The axis is normalized, so if the magnitude of the vector is viewed, it will be the *misorientation angle* in degrees.
