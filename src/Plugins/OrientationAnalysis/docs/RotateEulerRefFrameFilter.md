# RotateEulerRefFrame

## Group (Subgroup)

Orientation Analysis (Conversion)

## Description

This **Filter** performs a passive rotation (Right hand rule) of the Euler Angles about a user defined axis. The *reference frame* is being rotated and thus the *Euler Angles* necessary to represent the same orientation must change to account for the new *reference frame*.  The user can set an *angle* and an *axis* to define the rotation of the *reference frame*.
