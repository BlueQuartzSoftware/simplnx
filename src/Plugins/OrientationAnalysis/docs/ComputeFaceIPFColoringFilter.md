# Compute IPF Colors (Face)

## Group (Subgroup)

Processing (Crystallography)

## Description

This **Filter** generates a pair of colors for each **Triangle** in a **Triangle Geometry** based on the inverse pole figure (IPF) color scheme for the present crystal structure. Each **Triangle** has 2 colors since any **Face** sits at a boundary between 2 **Features** for a well-connected set of **Features** that represent _grains_. The reference direction used for the IPF color generation is the _normal_ of the **Triangle**.
