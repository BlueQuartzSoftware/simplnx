# ITK::Opening By Reconstruction Image Filter (KW)  #


## Group (Subgroup) ##

ITKImageProcessing (ITKImageProcessing)

## Description ##

Opening by reconstruction of an image.

This filter preserves regions, in the foreground, that can completely contain the structuring element. At the same time, this filter eliminates all other regions of foreground pixels. Contrary to the mophological opening, the opening by reconstruction preserves the shape of the components that are not removed by erosion. The opening by reconstruction of an image "f" is defined as:

OpeningByReconstruction(f) = DilationByRecontruction(f, Erosion(f)).

Opening by reconstruction not only removes structures destroyed by the erosion, but also levels down the contrast of the brightest regions. If PreserveIntensities is on, a subsequent reconstruction by dilation using a marker image that is the original image for all unaffected pixels.

Opening by reconstruction is described in Chapter 6.3.9 of Pierre Soille's book "Morphological Image Analysis: Principles and
Applications", Second Edition, Springer, 2003.

## Parameters ##

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| FullyConnected | bool| Set/Get whether the connected components are defined strictly by face connectivity or by face+edge+vertex connectivity. Default is FullyConnectedOff. For objects that are 1 pixel wide, use FullyConnectedOn. |
| PreserveIntensities | bool| Set/Get whether the original intensities of the image retained for those pixels unaffected by the opening by reconstrcution. If Off, the output pixel contrast will be reduced. |
| KernelRadius | FloatVec3_t| N/A |
| KernelType | int| N/A |
