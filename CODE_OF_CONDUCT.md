# Code of Conduct for simplnx

## 1. Introduction

At BlueQuartz Software, we are committed to fostering an inclusive, welcoming, and respectful community for everyone. Everyone is entitled to a harassment-free experience regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for community behavior and the procedures for reporting and handling unacceptable conduct.

## 2. Expected Behavior

We expect all community members, contributors, and maintainers to:

* **Be Respectful**: Value each other's ideas, styles, and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Be open to different possibilities and to be wrong. Be kind in all interactions and communications, especially when debating the merits of different options.
* **Be Direct but Professional**: We are likely to have some discussions about if and how we approach things. Those can be enriching and constructive discussions if approached with an open mind and a kind heart. Please avoid demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
* **Be Inclusive**: Actively seek to include and engage people in our community. Avoid jargon as it can be exclusionary.
* **Understand Differences**: Misunderstandings can occur in our multicultural community. Sometimes we may need some help to clear things up but stay open-minded and curious.

## 3. Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to:

* Harassing, intimidating, or discriminatory behavior.
* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, race, or religion.
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, and employment.
* Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
* Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
* Public or private harassment.
* Any form of direct or indirect threats.
* Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## 4. Reporting and Enforcement

* If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior—or have any other concerns—please report it by contacting the project maintainers at [info@bluequartz.net](mailto:info@bluequartz.net). All reports will be handled with discretion.
* If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the project maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a permanent ban from the community without warning.
