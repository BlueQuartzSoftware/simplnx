# ToDo list for python bindings

- Create each kind of geometry using the python bindings

  - combine that with numpy to generate some nodes for a node geometry

- Document all wrapped methods in the complexpy.cpp file.
- Example of using MatPlotLib to generate a plot and save the whole plot as an image file
- Example of using Pandas DataFrame
- Example of looping over X number of EBSD files and generate a Pole figure for each file
