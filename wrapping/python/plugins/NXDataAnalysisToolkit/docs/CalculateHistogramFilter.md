# Matplotlib: Calculate Histogram

## Group (Subgroup)

Utilities (Statistics)

## Description

**Calculate Histogram** is a Python-based *simplnx* filter designed to calculate histograms from data arrays and optionally generate a visual representation of the histogram. It computes the frequency distribution of data points in an array, dividing the entire range of values into a series of intervals (bins), and then counts how many values fall into each interval.

The histogram can be visualized as an image, with options to customize the size, resolution (DPI), and labels for the axes and title.

### Parameters

- `Number of Bins`: The number of bins in the histogram.
- `Generate Histogram Image`: Determines whether or not to generate an output histogram image.
- `Histogram Image Size`: The size of the output histogram image.
- `Histogram Image DPI`: The resolution of the output histogram image in dots per inch (DPI).
- `Histogram Title`: The title to display on the histogram image.
- `Histogram X Label`: The label for the X-axis of the histogram image.
- `Histogram Y Label`: The label for the Y-axis of the histogram image.
- `Histogram Geom Path`: The path in the data structure where the histogram geometry will be stored.
- `Histogram Stats Attribute Matrix Path`: The path in the data structure for storing statistics of the histogram.
- `Histogram Cell Attribute Matrix Name`: The name for the cell attribute matrix of the histogram.
- `Histogram Data Name`: The name for the histogram data.
