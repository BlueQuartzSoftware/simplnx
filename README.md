## Introduction ##

`complex` is a rewrite of the [SIMPL](https://www.github.com/bluequartzsoftware/simpl) library upon which [DREAM3D](https://www.github.com/bluequartzsoftware/dream3d) is written. This library aims to be fully C++17 compliant, removes the need for Qt5 at the library level and brings more flexible data organization and grouping options.

## Prerequisites ##

In order to compile `complex` you will need a C++17 compiler suite installed on your computer.

+ Compiler
  + Windows Visual Studio 2017 v141 toolset
  + macOS 10.15 and Xcode 12.4 or higher
  + Linux with GCC Version 9.0 or higher or clang.

## Install vcpkg ##

The `complex` project uses the [vcpkg](https://www.github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to manage it's dependent libraries. If this is not already installed on your system then you will need to download and compile it.

### Windows ###

Clone the vcpkg repository into a location that it will be used from. inside your home directory or at `C:/vcpkg` is a reasonable spot. *DO NOT USE A PATH WITH SPACES IN ANY OF THE FOLDERS*.

```(lang-console)
cd C:/Users/[USERNAME]/Applications
git clone https://www.github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
```

The `bootstrap-vcpkg.bat` file should be run automatically by CMake the first time. This will create the `vcpkg.exe` file. Additionally CMake should automatically find `vcpkg.exe`. If CMake does not find it, you may need to add it to your `PATH` variable.

### MacOS/Linux ###

Select an install location (the example below uses `/Users/Shared/DREAM3DNX_SDK/`) and then clone, build and install vcpkg.

```(lang-console)
mkdir -p /Users/Shared/DREAM3DNX_SDK/
cd /Users/Shared/DREAM3DNX_SDK/
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
export PATH=/Users/Shared/DREAM3DNX_SDK/vcpkg:$PATH
```

## Clone Appropriate Repositories ##

Within the folder DREAM3D-Dev clone both the `complex` and `DREAM3D_Data` repositories. The `DREAM3D_Data` repo is optional but does contain testing data.

Create a location to keep the `complex` repositories and make builds. You can do either in-source our out-of-source builds.

```(lang-console)
git clone --recursive https://github.com/bluequartzsoftware/complex
git clone --recursive https://github.com/DREAM3D/DREAM3D_Data
```

## Configure complex with CMake (Windows & MSVC) ##

For this example we are going to do an "in-source" build. By default git will ignore some basic names for build directories such as `Debug, Release, x64`. CMake can generate lots of project files from ninja, to nmake to Visual Studio. For this example we are going to use the `ninja` generator so we will need to keep the Debug and Release builds separated.

The first time `complex` is configured with CMake, VCPKG will download, build and install the needed dependent libraries. This can take a few minutes so be patient. After `complex` is configured you can build it using your IDE (Visual Studio) or ninja (QtCreator, CLion) or cmake itself.

```(lang-console)
cd complex
mkdir Release
cd Release

cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/Applications/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DVCPKG_MANIFEST_FEATURES="tests;parallel" ../../complex
```

Once the project is configured it should build using **ninja.exe**

Stop the VCPKG from checking for updates for each build adjust the cmake variable **-DVCPKG_MANIFEST_INSTALL=OFF**
